The project's goal is to create a fully functional web app that incorporates
Malignancy's features. Users can get rapid guidance on their cancer sickness using an
intelligent online system with this system. The Cancer Disease Prediction web
application is an online consultation and assistance project for end users. The
Malignancy is provided with numerous details as well as the cancer disease that goes
along with them. It then checks for various cancer diseases that could be linked to the
user's inputs by processing user-specific information. The neural network is used to
develop complex patterns from a wide range of high-dimensional data, an accurate
cancer diagnosis that might be associated with the user's information is predicted. The
specific doctors are displayed by system for further results for therapy. The technology
allows users to book appointment of doctors.
The objectives of the system that would benefit patients and participating
doctors:
i. Develop an appointment scheduling method for patient registration and
assess doctor accessibility
ii. Create a user-friendly online application for patient interaction which is
easily accessible and view doctor information.
iii. Implement a structured system capable of predicting accurate cancer
risks based on user data.
iv. Assess the functionality and effectiveness of the developed application in
meeting user needs and objectives.
